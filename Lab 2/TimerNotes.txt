Available Timers:
Timer0_A3 - TA0CTL
Timer1_A3 - TA1CTL
Timer0_B3 - TB0CTL
Timer1_B3 - TB1CTL - One I use in my Lib currently
Timer2_B3 - TB2CTL

Timer Interrupt Vectors:
TIMER2_B1_VECTOR - Timer2_B3 CC1-2
TIMER2_B0_VECTOR - Timer2_B3 CC0

TIMER1_B1_VECTOR - Timer1_B3 CC1-2
TIMER1_B0_VECTOR - Timer1_B3 CC0

TIMER1_A1_VECTOR - Timer1_A3 CC1-2
TIMER1_A0_VECTOR - Timer1_A3 CC0

TIMER0_A1_VECTOR - Timer0_A5 CC1-4
TIMER0_A0_VECTOR - Timer0_A5 CC0

TIMER0_B1_VECTOR - Timer0_B3 CC1-2
TIMER0_B0_VECTOR - Timer0_B3 CC0


From a really good ChatGPT answer:

For the control register naming:
TimerX_Yn
X - Timer module number (0, 1, 2)
Y - Timer family (A, B)
n - How many CCRs the timer has

For the interrupt vectors:
Each timer has two interrupt vectors, one for the CCR0 and one for the other CCRs


ChatGPT says:
Timer A family is better suited for basic tasks, more efficient
Timer B family is better for complex, more power consumption



EX:
Timer1_B3 - TB1CTL
TIMER1_B1_VECTOR - For CC1-2
TIMER1_B0_VECTOR - For CC0
