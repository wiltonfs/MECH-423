At max speed, servicing roughly every 250ms, we tx 246 counts. Max speed ~1count/ms
About 244 counts for a revolution, so max speed is ~4 Hz

For good control, we probably want to get encoder data at 5 Hz. So max encoder count should be ~200. So should be able to fit in one data byte, use the other byte for millis.

# Timer Distribution
For encoder velocity timing, we would like a timer overflowing at max 5 Hz

Encoder:
A0
A1

DC Motor:
TB2 - overflow at 123Hz

Stepper:
TB0 - low overflow, around 1Hz?
TB1 - low overflow, around 1Hz?
